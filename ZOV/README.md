We can roughly divide this information into two categories: systems and sources.

## Systems
Systems talk about the fundamental systems required for the functioning of the state as a construct. To be relevant for this overview, they should contain information about residents on a nationwide scale and draw a clear picture of these residents or add context to them. They can also be very specific, depending on the targeted residents.

## Sources
This categorie contains or references different sources that can be used for investigations; it may include leaks of the systems listed in the other categorie.
